You: "I love trying new restaurants, hiking on weekends, and going to art museums. I'm vegetarian and lactose intolerant. I usually take public transit or bike."

```

### üìä Session Summary
```

Bot: "Here's everything you need to update in your knowledge base:

üìä SESSION SUMMARY - March 15, 2024
‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ

```

## How It Works

The system uses YAML files to store:
- **Personal Profiles**: Your preferences and those of your friends
- **Interest Profiles**: Types of activities (Foodie, Adventurer, etc.)
- **Group Profiles**: Common configurations of people you hang out with
- **Settings**: Your default identity and relationship mappings

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be natural**: Say "I'm vegetarian and hate loud places" rather than listing restrictions
2. **Mention constraints**: "I have 2 hours" or "I prefer taking the train"
3. **Build incrementally**: You don't need to add everything at once
4. **Save updates**: When the bot shows you updates, copy them to keep your profiles current
5. **Ask about capabilities**: "Do you have calendar access?" to understand what's available

## Privacy & Data

- All profile data stays in your personal knowledge base
- The assistant only knows what you tell it and what's in your uploaded files
- You control all the information and can edit files directly
- No data is shared or stored outside your conversation

## Troubleshooting

**Bot says it lacks certain capabilities?**
- Core recommendations still work with just web search
- You can manually add calendar events based on suggestions
- Email templates can be provided for you to send yourself

**Recommendations seem generic?**
- Make sure you've set up your profile: "Set up my profile"
- Add more specific preferences: "I love spicy food and craft cocktails"
- Mention your location: "I'm in Brooklyn"

**Can't find someone's profile?**
- Check name variations: "Jon" vs "Jonathan"
- Ask: "Show me who you know about"
- Add them: "My friend Lisa loves hiking"
